Hello Everyone and welcome to my blog. My name is Aryan Chopra.
As a second-year BTech student in IT at VIT Vellore, I am passionate about exploring the potential of AI and ML technologies to enhance learning outcomes and accessibility for students with diverse needs and abilities. I have developed multiple skills in modeling and simulation, JavaScript, and Golang, and have earned several certifications in generative AI and prompt engineering from LinkedIn.

I have also contributed to the AI research community by co-authoring a pending publication that proposes a novel framework for using generative AI to create personalized and adaptive learning content for students with learning disabilities. This project reflects my values of innovation, inclusion, and social impact, and my goal of pursuing a research internship that allows me to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world challenges. Currently working on making Open Source contributions to LLMs.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
